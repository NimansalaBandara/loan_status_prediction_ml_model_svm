# Loan Approval Prediction using SVM

This project uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various applicant details. It is a classification problem in the domain of machine learning.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The model is trained using a dataset of loan applications, including features such as:

- Gender
- Marital Status
- Number of Dependents
- Education Level
- Employment Status
- Applicant & Co-applicant Income
- Loan Amount & Term
- Credit History
- Property Area

After training, the model can predict loan approval (Yes/No) for new user inputs.
