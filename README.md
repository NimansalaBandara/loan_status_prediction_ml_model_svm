# Loan Approval Prediction using SVM

This project uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various applicant details. It is a classification problem in the domain of machine learning.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The model is trained using a dataset of loan applications, including features such as:

- Gender
- Marital Status
- Number of Dependents
- Education Level
- Employment Status
- Applicant & Co-applicant Income
- Loan Amount & Term
- Credit History
- Property Area

After training, the model can predict loan approval (Yes/No) for new user inputs.

## 🧠 ML Model

- **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Education)
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature scaling (if applied)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
